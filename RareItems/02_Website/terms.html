      But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
      of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.<br><br>
      No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.<br><br>
      Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself.<br><br>
      Because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.<br><br>
      To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences.<br><br>
      Or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
